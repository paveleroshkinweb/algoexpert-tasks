You're given three inputs, all of which are instances of an
AncestralTree class that have an ancestor property
pointing to their youngest ancestor. The first input is the top ancestor in an
ancestral tree and the other two inputs are descendants in the ancestral
tree. 
Write a function that returns the youngest common ancestor to the two
descendants.
