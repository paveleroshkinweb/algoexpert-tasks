You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of potentially unequal height
and width containing only 0 and 1. Each 0 represents land, and each 1 represents part of a
river. A river consists of any number of 1 that are either
horizontally or vertically adjacent (but not diagonally adjacent). The number
of adjacent 1 forming a river determine its size. 
Write a function that returns an array of the sizes of all rivers represented
in the input matrix. The sizes don't need to be in any particular order.
