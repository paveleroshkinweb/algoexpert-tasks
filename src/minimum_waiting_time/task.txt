You're given a non-empty array of positive integers representing the amounts
of time that specific queries take to execute. Only one query can be executed
at a time, but the queries can be executed in any order.
A query's waiting time is defined as the amount of time that it must
wait before its execution starts. In other words, if a query is executed
second, then its waiting time is the duration of the first query; if a query
is executed third, then its waiting time is the sum of the durations of the
first two queries.
Write a function that returns the minimum amount of total waiting time for all
of the queries. For example, if you're given the queries of durations
