Imagine you have a set of cities that are laid out in a circle, connected by a
circular road that runs clockwise. Each city has a gas station that provides
gallons of fuel, and each city is some distance away from the next city.
You have a car that can drive some number of miles per gallon of fuel, and
your goal is to pick a starting city such that you can fill up your car with
that city's fuel, drive to the next city, refill up your car with that city's
fuel, drive to the next city, and so on and so forth until you return back to
the starting city with 0 or more gallons of fuel left.
This city is called a valid starting city, and it's guaranteed that there will
always be exactly one valid starting city.
