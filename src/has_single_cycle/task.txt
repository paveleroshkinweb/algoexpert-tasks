You're given an array of integers where each integer represents a jump of its
value in the array.
Write a function that returns a boolean representing whether the jumps in the
array form a single cycle. A single cycle occurs if, starting at any index in
the array and following the jumps, every element in the array is visited
exactly once before landing back on the starting index.
