An array of integers is said to represent the Binary Search Tree (BST)
obtained by inserting each integer in the array, from left to right, into the
BST. 
Write a function that takes in two arrays of integers and determines whether
these arrays represent the same BST. Note that you're not allowed to
construct any BSTs in your code.
