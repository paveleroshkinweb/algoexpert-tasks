A tandem bicycle is a bicycle that's operated by two people: person A and
person B. Both people pedal the bicycle, but the person that pedals faster
dictates the speed of the bicycle. 
You're given two lists of positive integers: one that contains the speeds of
riders wearing red shirts and one that contains the speeds of riders wearing
blue shirts. Each rider is represented by a single positive integer, which is
the speed that they pedal a tandem bicycle at. Both lists have the same
length, meaning that there are as many red-shirt riders as there are
blue-shirt riders. Your goal is to pair every rider wearing a red shirt with a
rider wearing a blue shirt to operate a tandem bicycle.
