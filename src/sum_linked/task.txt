You're given two Linked Lists of potentially unequal length. Each Linked List
represents a non-negative integer, where each node in the Linked List is a
digit of that integer, and the first node in each Linked List always
represents the least significant digit of the integer. Write a function that
returns the head of a new Linked List that represents the sum of the integers
represented by the two input Linked Lists.
