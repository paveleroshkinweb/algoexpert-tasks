Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree (where nodes have an additional
pointer to their parent node) as well as a node contained in that tree and
returns the given node's successor. 
A node's successor is the next node to be visited (immediately after the given
node) when traversing its tree using the in-order tree-traversal technique. A
node has no successor if it's the last node to be visited in the in-order
traversal.
