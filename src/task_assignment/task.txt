You're given an integer k representing a number of workers and an
array of positive integers representing durations of tasks that must be
completed by the workers. Specifically, each worker must complete two unique
tasks and can only work on one task at a time. The number of tasks will always
be equal to 2k.
Write a function that returns the optimal assignment of tasks to each worker
such that the tasks are completed as fast as possible. Your function should
return a list of pairs, where each pair stores the indices of the tasks that
should be completed by one worker.
